# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediciton

## Introduction

Concrete is one of the most commonly used construction materials in the construction industry around the world. It is mainly for as a structural material in construction

In construction, concrete consists of a suitable fine aggregate (typically sand) and coarse aggregates (typically gravel), that are bonded together by cement and water. However, at times, other binding agents such as lime and bitumen have been used to create lime concrete and asphaltic concrete respectively.

## Data Description

The data used in this analysis is attribted to the [UCI Machine Learning Repository ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/concrete+compressive+strength). The Data provides concrete compressive strengths with the material inputs of the concrete varied.
